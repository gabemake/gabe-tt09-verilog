## How it works

It's a game of skill and reaction speed. 

## How to test

Reset the game and press IN[0] to begin a countdown, where the number of seconds is set by IO[4:7}. Press IN[0] again as close as you can to the timer reaching 0 without going over. If you do not hit it in time, the display will say O-V-E-r, and if you do hit it in time, it will display the number of milliseconds you had to spare. The lowest score wins!

## External hardware

A button connecting IN[0] to ground will improve the gameplay experience quite a bit.
